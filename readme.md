A project in IELET1002 Computer Engineering

Three reservoirs connected vertically with optical sensors and valves to regulate water flow.
Each reservoir has an ESP32 which sends / receives information to / from a Raspberry Pi 3.
The Raspberry Pi 3 hosts a website with graphically represented data and a remote valve-control system.
